# scripts/common/session-start-claude.sh — TEMPLATE-OWNED core of the
# SessionStart hook for Claude Code.
#
# OWNERSHIP (shim/common/repo-local layout): this file is rendered by the
# rubio-standards template on every `copier update` — do NOT edit it in a
# consumer repo (edits are template drift). The execution chain is:
#   .claude/settings.json hook (matcher "startup|resume") →
#   scripts/session-start-claude-shim.sh (frozen consumer entry) →
#   THIS file (all logic) →
#   scripts/repo-local/session-start-claude.sh (optional, repo-owned startup).
#
# It runs AFTER Claude Code launches, on every session, in BOTH local and
# Claude Code on the web (cloud) environments. Follows the org contract proven
# by gha-outrunner, vibe-kanban, and karakeep: a thin cloud "Setup script"
# (scripts/common/cloud-setup.sh, entered via scripts/cloud-setup-shim.sh)
# warms the env-cache by running this hook's installs once; every later session
# re-runs this hook as a fast, idempotent no-op.
#
#   https://code.claude.com/docs/en/claude-code-on-the-web#setup-scripts-vs-sessionstart-hooks
#   https://code.claude.com/docs/en/hooks#sessionstart
#
# Contract (rubio-standards §6.1 — enforced by check.sh on CONTENT):
#   1. Abort-proof: every network/install/toolchain step is `|| true`, and the
#      script ALWAYS ends in `exit 0`. A SessionStart hook must never abort the
#      session. `set -euo pipefail` is kept for shellcheck/convention parity, so
#      every fallible step below is explicitly guarded.
#   2. Bridge GH_TOKEN -> GITHUB_TOKEN (mise's aqua backend resolves release
#      metadata via api.github.com and 403s on the unauthenticated rate limit).
#   3. Persist PATH via $CLAUDE_ENV_FILE — the only mechanism that exposes tools
#      to a session's later Bash calls (in-process exports do not carry).
#   4. Resolve the repo root from THIS script's location (BASH_SOURCE), NOT from
#      CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR, which in multi-repo workspaces may point at a parent
#      directory. CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR is used only as a non-authoritative sanity
#      cross-check (a warning on mismatch).
#   5. Emit a cloud-setup drift NOTE on stdout when the cloud-setup pair
#      (scripts/cloud-setup-shim.sh + scripts/common/cloud-setup.sh) and its
#      snapshot-persisted fingerprint disagree (silent no-op locally), and
#      a cloud plugin pre-seed health NOTE (5b) when a carrier-declared
#      marketplace or an enabled plugin's cache copy is missing from the
#      snapshot (silent locally and during the snapshot build itself).
#   6. Emit ONE concise line on stdout (a SessionStart hook's stdout becomes
#      Claude's context); all install chatter goes to stderr.
#   7. Idempotent: check-if-present before reinstalling.
#   8. Optional repo-local startup: after the warmup, run the repo-owned
#      scripts/repo-local/session-start-claude.sh (if present) for startup this
#      template cannot know about — extra toolchains, workspace installs, a dev
#      daemon, env defaults. Committed, repo-owned, NEVER rendered by the
#      template; abort-proof so it can never fail the session. Absent the file
#      this core is unchanged, so every rendered core is the same pure
#      template render.

# (5) Cloud env-cache drift check. scripts/common/cloud-setup.sh bakes a
# fingerprint (sha256 of the shim + core pair, concatenated) into a

# snapshot is stale — the cloud-setup core changed (usually via a copier-sync
# PR) but the snapshot predates it. Surface that as the one stdout NOTE so it
# reaches Claude as actionable context. Local sessions have no marker (the
# setup script is cloud-only), so this no-ops.
#
# CACHE-KEY CONVENTION (coherence-critical — keep in lockstep with
# scripts/common/cloud-setup.sh): the marker is keyed on the RUNTIME
# checked-out directory name, $(basename "$repo_root"), NOT the copier
# project_name answer. The cloud-setup core WRITES the fingerprint to this
# exact same path, so the path this hook READS and the path that script WRITES
# are byte-identical regardless of whether project_name matches the
# checkout-dir name. Keying this side on the project_name answer would
# silently break the NOTE whenever a consumer clones into a directory whose
# name differs from project_name. The HASH convention must also stay in
# lockstep: cat shim + core | sha256sum, same file order.

# (5b) Cloud plugin pre-seed health check. scripts/common/cloud-setup.sh
# pre-seeds the carrier's plugin marketplaces into the environment snapshot (its
# "Marketplace pre-seed" section — a workaround while Claude Code on the web
# launches sessions with SKIP_PLUGIN_MARKETPLACE=true, which disables native
# marketplace sync and would otherwise orphan every enabledPlugins entry).
# Every failure mode there is non-fatal by design, so a failed pre-seed
# (missing/expired GH_PAT in the Setup-script wrapper, a network-policy
# block, a snapshot predating the workaround) would otherwise surface only as
# silently missing plugins. A marketplace is healthy only if BOTH its
# on-disk copy and its registry entry exist — tested via the
# .claude-plugin/marketplace.json manifest that resolution actually reads,
# NOT via .git: Claude Code's native handling of claude-plugins-official
# replaces the pre-seeded git clone with a GITLESS directory at session
# start, which is perfectly healthy (observed live). A healthy marketplace
# is still not enough — each enabled plugin must also be installed into the
# plugin cache, or startup resolution drops it with "plugin-cache-miss"
# (observed live: 2 seeded marketplaces, 0 plugins loaded). Cloud-only:
# locally Claude Code
# syncs marketplaces natively and ~/.claude/plugins is none of our business.
# CLOUD_SETUP_BUILD=1 marks the cloud-setup core's own build-time invocation
# of this core, where the pre-seed has not run yet — skip there too. Remove
# this check together with the pre-seed workaround.
